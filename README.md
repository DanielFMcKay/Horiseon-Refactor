# Horiseon-Refactor

This README file is for a weekly assignment for the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, in which I refactor the code for a fictional marketing agency for readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

Per the README instructions in the Week 1 Challenge folder, I replaced non-semantic elements with semantic ones, replacing all <div> tags and making float class names more obvious in their function.

I also added alt text to all images for visually impaired accessibility.

I also added a header section and title.

I included coding comments in both the Index.html and style.css files to quickly denote each section and its function, and re-ordered the classes and elements in the style.css file to better reflect their order in the html and visually on the page.

Finally, although it was not requested, I added a reset.css file for better web browser compatibility.

This is my first README file written from scratch.
