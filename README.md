# Horiseon-Refactor

This README file is for a weekly assignment for the UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, in which I refactor the code for a fictional marketing agency for readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

* Per the README instructions in the Week 1 Challenge folder, I replaced non-semantic elements with semantic ones, replacing all div tags and making float class names more obvious in their function.

* I also added alt text to all images for visually impaired accessibility.

* I also added a title and header section, making sure everything in the header section was in the correct order.
  
* Additionally, I inspected the HTML elements already in the file to make sure they were in a logical structure.

* Finally, I included coding comments in both the Index.html and style.css files to quickly denote each section and its function, and re-ordered the classes and elements in the style.css file to better reflect their order in the html and visually on the page.
